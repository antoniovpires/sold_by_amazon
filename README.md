# Sold by Amazon
This is the code for a Chrome Extension I've developed to make my life easier. It filters Amazon products for the ones that are sold and delivered by Amazon.

The functionality is quite easy, you just search for whatever you want in Amazon, open de the extension and click the button.
That simple.
That fast.

It's already avaiable in Chrome Web Store: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sold-by-amazon/ghagokknibkkmopebodjlckaplocddib?hl=pt-br
